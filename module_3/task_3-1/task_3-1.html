      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When wakeUpTime is 7 you would get "You can catch the bus". If wakeUpTime is greater than 7 you would get "You can't catch the bus!". ]</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If wakeUpTime is 7 you would get the same result, but if wakeUpTime is greater than 8 you would get "You can take the train to school, or you have to use your car."]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[If wakeUpTime 7 you would still get the same, but now if wakeUpTime 8 you would get " I can take the train to school". otherwise you would get " I have to take the car to school."]</p>
     
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[you would get that the value of 0 is zero. Zero is positive. Everything below zero is negative.]</p>
